# Activity-Recognition
Project on Human activity Recognition

## Method

### Convlstm
In a ConvLSTM network, the input to each LSTM cell is convolved, meaning the LSTM operations (input-to-state and state-to-state transitions) are performed in the convolutional space. This makes ConvLSTM particularly suitable for tasks like human activity recognition from video sequences, 

## How to Run 
 * Create the dataset set by running the `dataset.py`
   ```
   python dataset.py
   ```
* Run the training script to start training the model
  ```
  python train.py
  ```
